<!--Paragraph 1-->

        <p>Biology is an enormous and complex field of study, where numerous topics are covered, ranging from the smallest molecules essential to life (Molecular Biology), to the human body (Human Physiology), to entire ecosystems (Ecology). Biology -ultimately- is not only the study of living organisms but also the study of their interconnection with the environment.
            However, what are living organisms that an entire field is dedicated to? What specific actions does a living organism have to perform in order to be considered alive?  
            The answer is quite straightforward: There are eight functions of life an organism has to independently perform to be considered alive: Metabolism, Respiration, Sensitivity, Homeostasis, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion and Nutrition. They have to perform all of them independently to be considered alive, even if an organism performs seven out of the eight functions is still not considered alive if it cannot perform the last one. 
            An easy way to remember all the functions is to use the following mnemonic device:

        <p> But what exactly are these functions that constitute life? <br> 
            <span><b>Metabolism</b> is the undertaking of essential chemical reactions. They can be either anabolic or catabolic reactions. Catabolic reactions are the breakdown of complex organic molecules into smaller ones, e.g. Digestion. </span>
            Anabolic reactions are reactions that involve the building of complex organic molecules from smaller ones e.g. Photosynthesis.</span>    
            <span><b>Respiration</b> is the catabolic chemical reaction where molecules are broken down in order for energy to be released for metabolism e.g. anaerobic cellular respiration. </span> 
            <span><b>Sensitivity</b> is the response to an internal or external stimulus e.g. The Reflex Arc, which is an almost instantaneous and involuntary movement in response to a stimulus such as quickly removing your hand from a hot surface. </span>            
            <span><b>Homeostasis</b> is the process of maintaining a stable internal environment, to achieve equilibrium. The word homeostasis comes from Greek, where “Homeo'' means similar/the same and “Stasis ” stable, thus meaning that homeostasis refers to all the processes that an organism undertakes in order to stay in the same- similar, stable conditions e.g. Regulating the body temperature for it to be neither too hot nor too cold.

            <span><b>Growth</b> is the ability to move, change shape and/or size e.g. An erythrocyte developing in the bone marrow. .   </span>          
            <span><b>Reproduction</b> is the production of offspring- either asexually or sexually e.g. Selfing or sexual intercourse (respectively).            
            Excretion is the removal of waste products of metabolism, e.g. urination, and surplus of substances e.g. Vomiting excess alcohol.            
            Nutrition is the intake, absorption and assimilation of organic substances for energy, growth and development e.g. Eating lasagna.

            What is the difference between parasites and viruses? And why is one considered to be alive while the other is not? Well, parasites are organisms that reside inside other organisms, usually from a different species. 
            These organisms in which they reside are called the host and by obtaining resources, such as nutrients from it, it drains the host’s supplies, consequently causing harm to its body. This relationship between the parasites and the host is called a parasitic relation. 
            Viruses are considered to be intracellular (inside the cell) parasites since they also need to reside inside an organism to survive, but they are not considered alive because they cannot metabolize or reproduce without the aid of a host cell (which is done by taking over the host’s machinery and cellular processes), meaning that they cannot perform some functions of life independently. 
            Contrastingly, other parasites do not need the host to perform any of the characteristics of life for them, they can do all of them by themselves, thus, they are considered living organisms.
